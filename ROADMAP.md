# Travel Canvas Project Roadmap

## Phase 1: Smart Scheduling (Current - Completed)
- **Smart Sorting**: Automatic time-slot assignment (Morning/Afternoon/Evening/Night) based on changed time.
- **Auto-Chronological Sorting**: Items within a slot are automatically sorted by time.
- **Visual Conflict Detection (V1)**: Visual warning (red card/label) when items overlap based on suggested duration.
- **Data Integrity System**: Auto-repair logic that ensures items are always in the correct slot after a data load or sync.

## Phase 2: Smart Assistant & Conflict Resolution (Planned)
- **Quick-Fix Assistant**: Add an "Auto-Align" button next to conflict warnings.
- **Slot-First Duration Adjustment**: One-click to reduce the previous item's duration to perfectly fit the next activity.
- **Mobile Layout Refinement**: Redesign schedule card layouts specifically for smaller screens to improve readability and space efficiency.
- **User-Defined Durations**: Allow manual input for activity length.
- **Visual Refinement**: Shift from "Warning" (Red) to "Information" (Blue/Slate) to reduce planning anxiety.
